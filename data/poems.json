    "The world is wide, a shifting sea, Of faces lost in time and tide.But in the rush, you’re home to me, The place where all my fears subside. It isn’t found in grand design, Or promised in the morning blue; It’s simply that your light met mine, And suddenly, the world felt new.",
    "I never knew a heart could speak,Without a single whispered word. It’s in the quiet pulse we keep,The sweetest song I’ve ever heard. Like echoes in a canyon deep,Or moonlight on a silver lake, You are the promise I will keep, The very breath I choose to take.",
    "Stars may flicker, seasons depart, And ancient mountains turn to sand. But there's a map inside my heart, That leads back to your steady hand. No matter where the road may bend,Or how the winter winds may blow,You are my start and you're my end,The only truth I need to know.",
    "Some write their love in ink and gold,Or carve it deep in weathered stone. I write ours in the days we hold,And in the life that we have grown. It’s in the coffee in the morn, The tired smiles at close of day,A thousand tiny moments born, To light the shadows on our way.",
    "You are the rhythm, I the rhyme, A melody that's just begun. A tether in the reach of time, The shadow and the morning sun.If every lifetime were a book,I'd search the shelves for every line,To find the way your spirit shook,The very foundations of mine."
